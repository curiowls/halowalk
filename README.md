# HaloWalk

SwiftUI implementation of the HaloWalk wireframes. Two targets in one Xcode
project: an iOS Guardian app for parents/family, and a watchOS Watcher app for
the kid or senior wearing the watch.

The visual language is **theme-driven**. The first theme — `Sketch` — matches
the heartwarming hand-drawn wireframes. The architecture supports up to 5
themes; pickers in both apps surface them once registered.

## Setup

```bash
brew install xcodegen           # one-time
./Scripts/setup.sh              # fetch fonts + generate HaloWalk.xcodeproj
open HaloWalk.xcodeproj
```

Then in Xcode:

1. Select the **HaloWalk** target → Signing & Capabilities → set your Apple Developer team.
2. Repeat for the **HaloWalk Watch App** target.
3. Build & run. Selecting an iPhone with a paired Apple Watch will install both apps; on a real iPhone+Watch pair, the Watcher installs to the Watch automatically.

## Theme system

A theme is a single `Theme` value (see `Shared/Theme/Theme.swift`) that bundles:

- `palette` — ink, paper, halo colors, accents
- `typography` — four font roles (body / display / flow script / mono) + scale
- `geometry` — wobble corner radii, drop-shadow offsets, tilt allowance
- `strokes` — line widths and dash patterns
- `map` — `.sketch` (hand-drawn fake map), `.kit` (real MapKit), or `.kitTextured`

To add a new theme:

1. Define a new `Theme` instance (e.g. `Theme.modernFlat`) in
   `Shared/Theme/<Name>Theme.swift`.
2. Add it to `Theme.allRegistered` in `SketchTheme.swift`.
3. Both the watch ⚙ menu and the Guardian settings sheet pick it up automatically.

The design conversation suggested 3–5 total themes targeting both senior and
youth aesthetics — the registration list reserves slots for four more, with
"Coming soon" placeholder rows in the Guardian picker.

### Theming maps

- `.sketch` → renders our hand-drawn `SketchMapView` with squiggle roads, halo rings, and pin glyphs. No real geodata.
- `.kit` → real MapKit (iOS only). Per the design conversation, only the *controls and overlays* are themed; the map tiles themselves stay native.
- `.kitTextured` → MapKit with a multiply-blend overlay layer for a softer, more sketch-like feel.

watchOS (currently) always renders the sketch map regardless of theme — the
`MapContent` builder API is iOS 17+ only. This is documented at the
`#if os(watchOS)` branch in `Shared/Components/SketchMap.swift`.

## Variants

Every screen ships **all three variants** from the design exploration. Per the
chat transcript:

> "Instead of picking one out of ABC version and implementing it, I'm
> considering implementing three screens for each state that the user can
> choose to interact with. Over time, we will learn which one is the
> preferred mode."

- **Watch**: 3 swipe variants per screen via `TabView(.page)`. Selected page
  is persisted in `VariantPrefs` so the app reopens to your preferred surface.
- **iOS**: same pattern — each tab wraps its 3 variants in a paged TabView,
  with a small variant label + dot indicator at the top so you always know
  which sketch you're looking at.

`Settings → Default variants` (watch) and the variant indicator (iOS) let you
pick the default. Pilot telemetry on which variant gets used most should
inform the eventual default.

## Where the design came from

- `chats/chat1.md` — the design conversation, including the Watch v2 changes
  (Glance A → turn-by-turn, Hubs C → time-aware Suggested, Wander A →
  enlarge halo) and the Notifications/Respond expansion.
- `HaloWalk Wireframes.html` and the `*.jsx` files were the React/Babel
  prototype the user iterated against. Visual decisions in this Swift
  implementation match those files; the behaviors there were prototype-only,
  this is the real app.

## Pilot caveats

- All data is mocked (`Shared/Mock/MockData.swift`). Wire `LocationManager`,
  `WatchConnectivity`, `UNUserNotificationCenter`, and a backend before pilot.
- Custom fonts gracefully fall back to system rounded if the .ttf files are
  missing — but for the heartwarming feel, run `Scripts/fetch-fonts.sh` first.
- `WatchConnectivity` for iPhone↔Watch sync isn't wired yet — the
  `ThemeManager` lives in each target's UserDefaults independently. Add a
  WCSession transfer when connecting real backends.
- The Guardian map shows a fictional San Francisco neighborhood for `.kit`
  themes (see `MockData.realRegion`). Replace with the user's actual hub
  coordinates when location is wired.
